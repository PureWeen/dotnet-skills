# Artifact acquisition

Use this before assessing a distributed package. Transport failure must not redefine a release as
source-only.

## Published package

1. Record the configured public package source and requested ID/version.
2. Discover the latest stable only as a draft default; ask the owner to confirm the exact version.
3. Use the package source's standard metadata and content endpoints to confirm and retrieve the
   exact original nupkg. Use a bounded alternate endpoint only when the primary route fails.
4. Record every attempt with subject, locator, retrieval method, result, and bounded detail.
   Allowed results are `succeeded`, `not-found`, `access-denied`, `unavailable`,
   `invalid-content`, and `network-failure`.
5. Hash before extraction. Canonical ID/version come from the nuspec inside those exact bytes.
6. A package cache is acceptable only when origin and exact original bytes are established. A local
   rebuild is not the published artifact.

Network, proxy, authentication, DNS, or tool failure is a retrieval result, not a product `gap`.
Continue with only claims the retained evidence can support; affected applicable rows are
`not tested` or `owner evidence required`.

## Release candidate

Use the owner-supplied local `.nupkg`, record acquisition as `release-candidate`, bind its SHA-256,
and start a distinct package root when bytes change even if the semantic version does not.

## Minimum package inspection

- nuspec identity, license, repository, authors, project, and source-commit metadata;
- files, target frameworks, dependencies, bundled scripts/styles/fonts/themes/notices;
- every shipped managed assembly, keeping strong-name, Authenticode, and package signatures
  separate;
- SBOM/provenance correspondence to the exact final package digest;
- source mapping to a reachable exact commit when source is available.

Honor validator ceilings: 256 MiB nupkg, 1 MiB nuspec, 4 MiB authored ledger, 64 MiB serialized
artifact, and at most 32 supplemental evidence inputs totaling 64 MiB.

Extract and probe outside the reviewed repository. Remove disposable extraction/probe trees and raw
logs after retaining bounded commands, results, relevant snippets, and digests.
